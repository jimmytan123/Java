 * NOTE TO PROGRAMMER:
 * Implement each method as per its description.
 * Do not change the javadoc commenting or
 * the method header.
 * You may remove this comment block when you are finished.
 *
 * NOTE that some methods have a return statement.
 * These are to ensure that the shell will compile successfully.
 * They will need to be replaced with working code.
 * 
 * BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING:
 * Put all the java files into a single directory and type:
 * 	javac *.java
 * Even though nothing works yet, everything compiles.
 * Successful compilation produces no output, but a set of *.class
 * files were created.
 *
 * Next, check out the professional web documentation that
 * is created (by extracting the javadoc comments above each method).
 * Type:
 *	javadoc *.java
 * Then open (double-click) the file called index.html.
